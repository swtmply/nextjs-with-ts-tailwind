This is my boilerplate for my future NextJS projects

## Getting Started

First, install the packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Why I chose these techs

I have a lot of researches done before choosing these, it may change over the course of my journey. But, for now this is my stack, I guess.

- [NextJS with Typescript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) - learn about Next.js typescript.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.
